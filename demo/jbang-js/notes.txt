We are going to make a Chicory release by the end of the week, for now:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dylibso/chicory.git
cd chicory
mvn -Dquickly
```

after you can run the script with:

```bash
jbang js "console.log('Hey Max!');"
```

Or to make Java ppl chuckle:

```bash
jbang js "console.log('Hey Max! Enjoy Javascript ' + 'ba'+(+'a')+'as');"
```
